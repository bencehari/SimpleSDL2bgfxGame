# Starters

- [Minimal bgfx + SDL2 (github.com)](https://gist.github.com/zlash/abf8d4bc2efb795a02361e4820a2da10): for making SDL2 and bgfx work (not working as is, but it is a good starter).
- [bgfx/examples/25-c99/helloworld.c at master Â· bkaradzic/bgfx (github.com)](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/blob/master/examples/25-c99/helloworld.c): gives a little taste of bgfx with C99. Not much, most of my code ported from C++.
- [pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter: A starter project for graphics applications using SDL, bgfx and Dear ImGui (github.com)](https://github.com/pr0g/sdl-bgfx-imgui-starter): haven't dived into it yet, but seems good at first glance.
